Crosswinds Theme, version 1.0  12/20/07

This black on white two-column theme has a wind-blown look from left to right, a clean design, 
and supports widgets.

The theme options include a "blue", "green", or "orange" variation of the color scheme, placement
of the sidebar on the left or right, and if the author name should be shown on posts.
